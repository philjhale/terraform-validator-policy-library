metadata:
  name: require_labels
spec:
  severity: high
  match:
    target: ["project/*"]
  parameters: 
    # required parameter: list of label objects that resources should have.
    # A label object is composed of a key value pair like: 
    #
    #   "label_key": "label_value_regex_to_match"
    #
    # Any missing label results in a violation. For instance a resource with no label1 or label2 label,
    # in this sample case, would raise 2 violations: one for label1 being absent and one for label2.
    #
    # In the same spirit, a resource with label1 or label2 present, but with values not matching their respective regex
    # would also raise one violation per mismatch. 
    #
    # In the following example, valid values for a label named "label1" would be only "label1-value",
    # but a label named label2 could have various values like "label2-value", "label2-valueOK" etc. 
    #
    # A violation is raised if the label value does not match the pattern passed as a parameter here.
